### Overview
An extremely simple react application. The application uses [BoredApi](https://www.boredapi.com/). 

To use it, you need to click on the button in the center and after a few seconds a container with data will appear.

The code is not perfect so. :smiley:

### Setup `npm install`
just open Terminal or Command Prompt in the project directory and write `npm install`

Nothing complicate. :grin:

### Run `npm run` || `yarn start`
After installation, it is still easier to write `npm run` or `yarn start`
